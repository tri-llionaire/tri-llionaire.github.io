KEYWORDS
abstract	    A non-access modifier. Used for classes and methods: An abstract class cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited from another class). An abstract method can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited from)

CONDITIONALS
if (condition1) {
    // execute
} else if (condition2) {
    // execute
} else {
    // execute }
TERNARY OPERATOR
variable name = (condition) ? executeIfExpressionTrue :  executeIfExpressionFalse;
SWITCH
switch(expression) {
  case x:
    // execute
    break;
  case y:
    // execute
    break;
  default:
    // execute }
WHILE LOOP
while (condition) {
    // execute }
do {
    // execute }    //does the code block first, then does a while loop of it
while (condition);
FOR LOOP
for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
    // code block to be executed }
Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.
For example: (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
for (type variableName : arrayName) {
    // code block to be executed }
Basically meaning for variable of type in array
break kills a loop, continue skips that iteration but then goes back to it
String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};  //defines an array with string values called cars
Access values in array with cars[indexnumber], and also modify same way
Use .length to get length of array
int[][] myNumbers = { {1, 2, 3, 4}, {5, 6, 7} };    //multidimensional array
int x = myNumbers[1][2];                            //outputs 7
public class Main { static void myMethod(String name) { } }    //basically a def myMethod(): in python
Can also use return in user-defined methods
void means no data is being returned, while int, string, etc mean there is
You can use the same method name multiple times with different parameters for simplicity
You can call a method from inside the method (recursion)
class: Fruit
objects: Apple, Banana, Mango
Main.java
public class Main {
  int x = 5;
}
Second.java
class Second {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main();
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
Created an object to reference another file; you can also modify myObj.x now and it'll change in Main unless it's final
Set a method to static to make it callable; public is for use for objects and can be called with myObj.method(parameter)
public class Main {
  int x;

  public Main(int y) {
    x = y;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Main myObj = new Main(5);
    System.out.println(myObj.x);
  }
}
Can use a constructor to initialize values
